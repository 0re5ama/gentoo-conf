# MPlayer input control file
#
# You are able to redefine default keyboard/joystick/mouse/LIRC bindings, or
# add new ones here.
# See DOCS/tech/slave.txt for possible commands that can be bound.
# Also see mplayer -input cmdlist for other possible options.
# The file should be placed in the $HOME/.mplayer directory.
#
# If you wish to unbind a key, use key ignore.
# e.g. ENTER ignore
#
# Note that merely removing default key bindings from this file won't remove
# the default bindings mplayer was compiled with, unless
#   --input=nodefault-bindings
# is specified.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
#
# Some characters need to be escaped. In particular, if you want to display
# a '\' character as part of an osd_show_property_text OSD message, you have to
# escape 2 times:
# key  osd_show_property_text "This is a single backslash: \\\\!"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta, but note that currently reading
# key combinations is only supported through the video windows of X-based
# output drivers (not in output windows of other drivers or in a terminal).

# Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are mostly limited by keyframes
RIGHT seek 10
LEFT seek -10
UP seek 60
DOWN seek -60
# Do smaller, always exact (non-keyframe-limited), seeks with shift.
Shift+RIGHT no-osd seek  1 exact
Shift+LEFT  no-osd seek -1 exact
Shift+UP    no-osd seek  5 exact
Shift+DOWN  no-osd seek -5 exact
